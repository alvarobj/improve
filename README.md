# About
We present IMPROVE [1], a multimodal database for assessing the impact of mobile phone usage on learners engaged in online education in a 30-minutes learning session. IMPROVE is a database which is initially introduced in arXiv technical report and currently under review in [Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/) journal.

The IMPROVE database was developed to assess the impact of mobile phone usage on learners engaged in online education in a 30-minutes learning session. It evaluates not only academic performance and learner feedback but also captures biometric, behavioral, and physiological signals, enabling a thorough analysis of how mobile phone use affects learning. Data were collected from 120 learners, categorized into three groups based on their levels of mobile phone interaction. A variety of sensors were utilized to gather data, including electroencephalography (EEG) waves, RGB videos, eye tracking, and heart rate, all of which have been shown in cutting-edge research to be effective indicators of learner behavior and cognition. The database also features metadata derived from processed videos, such as face bounding boxes, facial landmarks, and Euler angles for head pose estimation. Additionally, it contains performance data and self-reported questionnaires from the learners. Phone usage events were labeled, encompassing both supervisor-triggered and uncontrolled instances.
# Motivation
The ever-increasing use of mobile phones has profoundly influenced various aspects of our lives, including education. While online education offers flexibility and accessibility, it also poses unique challenges such as lack of interaction between learners and intructors, feelings of isolation while learning and distractions. Despite extensive research in education and cognitive sciences, there remains a lack of comprehensive datasets that investigate the multimodal impact of mobile phone interaction on learners during online education as the majority of studies focus on face-to-face learning and most of them only rely in surveys and questionnaires. 

IMPROVE is designed to enable researchers and educators to assess the nuanced effects of mobile phone usage on learning outcomes during a 30-minute online learning session. Unlike traditional datasets that focus solely on academic performance or subjective feedback, IMPROVE offers a rich multimodal perspective. It integrates biometric, behavioral, and physiological data, making it a valuable resource for exploring questions at the intersection of education, psychology, and human-computer interaction.

The database stands out for its multidisciplinary approach, incorporating data from EEG signals, eye-tracking, heart rate monitoring, and high-resolution RGB videos. This multimodal design provides a holistic view of how mobile phone usage impacts attention, cognitive load, and emotional states. The inclusion of detailed metadata such as facial landmarks, head pose estimation, and phone usage events ensures that the dataset is both versatile and robust for a wide range of analyses.

By making this resource available to the scientific community, we aim to foster innovative research on digital distractions, learner engagement, and adaptive educational systems. The insights derived from IMPROVE have the potential to inform policies, design interventions, and develop tools that mitigate the negative impact of mobile phone distractions in online learning environments, ultimately enhancing the quality and effectiveness of online education.
