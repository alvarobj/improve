# About
The IMPROVE database was developed to assess the impact of mobile phone usage on learners engaged in online education in a 30-minutes learning session. It evaluates not only academic performance and learner feedback but also captures biometric, behavioral, and physiological signals, enabling a thorough analysis of how mobile phone use affects learning. Data were collected from 120 learners, categorized into three groups based on their levels of mobile phone interaction. A variety of sensors were utilized to gather data, including electroencephalography (EEG) waves, RGB videos, eye tracking, and heart rate, all of which have been shown in cutting-edge research to be effective indicators of learner behavior and cognition. The database also features metadata derived from processed videos, such as face bounding boxes, facial landmarks, and Euler angles for head pose estimation. Additionally, it contains performance data and self-reported questionnaires from the learners. Phone usage events were labeled, encompassing both supervisor-triggered and uncontrolled instances.
